# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Connect-4-in-a-Line-Game-Bot-Training
The objective is to design and train an RL agent capable of making optimal moves in Connect 4, a classic two-player board game. The bot learns play strategically, making decisions to win or prevent the opponent from winning, ultimately achieving a high level of gameplay proficiency.

# The Controls.
Simply use left/right arrow keys to navigate across different columns of the board and press enter to drop a coin.

# Running the Code.
To initiate the training process for the computer, go to the main menu and select "Train Computer." During this training, the computer will play a specified number of games, which is provided as an argument to the program.
After the training is complete, you can choose the "vs Computer" option, allowing a human player to compete against the computer that has just been trained. It's important to note that every time you select the "Train Computer" mode, the training process starts anew from the beginning.
